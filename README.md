# Weather-Search-Project
Weather Search app using data from WeatherAPI

This was my very first project using any sort of API, wanted to try to keep
it simple with a weather one. I faced many challenges when trying to get my
requests to work properly but I was eventually satisifed enough to continue
the project. Using fetch for the first time I don't know if it was my lack of
experience, but the requests along with declaring multiple variables seemed to
be redundant at times but I'm sure as I practice and create more projects I will
learn to be more efficient with my code. The styling and layout was fairly simple
and used VanillaJS and CSS. Overall this project was lots of fun and I am happy
with the outcome considering my experience level.
